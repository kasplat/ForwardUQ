My repository with my research on Uncertainty Quantification in a electrophysiological model. 
The slides for my talk at the SIAM Annual Meeting 2018 are available here: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1DrfloOixm5PhOSoS6NtvA6hoXjHkd5MCusxs82YM87Y/edit?usp=sharing
## Explanation
The bulk of the time spent on research was spent trying to find out different ways to reduce the input dimension for the model.
I tried using things like region growing, k means, and EM clustering. However, DBSCAN was preferable for our model for many reasons.

You can view some of the results in the presentation.
