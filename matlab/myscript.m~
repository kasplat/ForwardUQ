%% intensity study
% I don?t think it is a good idea to use the absolute values of image 
%intensities, because the intensities in different patients may vary a lot,
%and also different scanners may have great difference too, so you would 
%better consider using percentage of the whole intensities in the ventricle
%wall to segment different tissues.
% 
% One example:
% 
% The intensities in one ventricle wall (between epicardium and 
%endocardium) are from 10 to 220, you can select the tissue with smaller 
% than 20% of the intensities (220 -10=210; 210*0.20=41; 10+41=51) as 
%normal tissue, which is 51 in the example; and select the tissue with 
%smaller than 40% of the intensities as grey zone, which is 
%94 (10+210*0.4); and the rest tissue is core scar. So one set of 
%parameters mentioned here should be 20% and 40%, and you can choose other 
%values as you want. Like range [10%-40%] as the threshold value between 
%normal tissue and Gray zone, range [30%-60%] as the threshold value 
%between core scar and Gray zone.
% 
% Hope my explanation can help you select these values.
% The whole image intensity is from 0 to 180, but the image intensity in the 
% segmented tissue is from 1 to 130, so the values to segment normal tissue 
% and gray zone should vary from 15% * (130 -1) to 25% *(130 -1), but the 
% values to segment gray zone and core scar should be calculated differently,
% Here I only take 15% as am example. 15%*(130-1) is about 20, so from 20 to 
% 130 is infarcted tissue, then you can segment the gray zone and core scar
% from 20 + 10%*(130-20)=31 to 20+60%*(130-20)=86, so this means that you can
% change the values from 31 to 86 with the steps you want, but you should not
% make the step too small, 5% (5%*110=5.5, so you can use 5) may be a good 
% value for the step, but you can choose a smaller one if you think this 
% value is too big. 
% Then you can repeat these steps for other threshold values.
